# A simple yet effective method for spectrogram transformation

** Resolution-Adaptive Spectrogram: A simple yet effective method for spectrogram transformation. **
## Overview

The Resolution-Adaptive Spectrogram provides an approach to modify the frequency resolution of a spectrogram nonlinearly, adapting to the active frequency range dynamically. The process involves:

1. **Active Frequency Range Search**: Identifying the range of frequencies where significant activity is observed.
2. **Nonlinear Frequency Resolution Adjustment**: Adapting the frequency resolution based on the identified active range, ensuring optimal representation.

This approach is effective in enhancing the visualization and analysis of time-frequency data, particularly in applications such as human activity recognition.
